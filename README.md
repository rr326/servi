# Servi

## TODO
* Ansible needs python 2. How to deal with that?
    * Try a vanilla ansible install (not in a venv)
* Install servi.sh in /usr/bin (or whatever is the right directory)?

* Test scripts (py.test)
* commands: 
    * lans, rans
    * diff

* Look at Docker - would that have done all of this???
