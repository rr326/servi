## TODO
* Ansible
* Servi
    * commands:
        * lans, rans
    * Use logging instead of qprint
    * use new python path module

* Look at Docker - would that have done all of this???

* Templates
    * Remove static ips? (and use that tool that does *.dev?)

* Backups - is it making unnecessary backups?

* Documentation after init
    * etc/hosts
    * Modify Servifile.yml
    * Whatever your 'sitesuffix' is, make sure you create sitesuffix.conf in apache
    * vagrant reload
    * vagrant provision
